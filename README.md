# TiddlyWiki5 Syntax README

This extension adds TiddlyWiki5 syntax-highlighting to Visual Studio Code. [TiddlyWiki5](http://tiddlywiki.com) is a rich, interactive tool for manipulating complex data with structure that doesn't easily fit into conventional tools like spreadsheets or wordprocessors. It is a javascript environment that lives in the Browser, Node.js (and a few other implementations) which builds a Wiki/Content Management System out of the smallest semantically meaningful chunks â€“ named ''tiddlers''. When run in the browser, each ''tiddler'' is a javascript object in memory (and a <div> of data in the file).

When run with Node.js, TiddlyWiki saves each ''tiddler'' to disk as a separate text file. This extension is intended when editing seperate riddler files with Visual Studio Code.

## Features
